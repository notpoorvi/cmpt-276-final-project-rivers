## Project Objective:
Our primary goal is to develop a user-friendly Recipe Discovery Website. The goal of this platform is about creating an experience around exploring, planning, and truly enjoying a diverse range of culinary delights, much more than just getting recipes. TLDR, our platform works on the front-end. It smoothly utilizes APIs to give users an exciting, varied and interactive culinary journey, giving them lots of agency over the dishes they are interested in. We've carefully planned the website to be as inclusive as possible, catering to users with varying levels of culinary expertise.

## Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: React, Bootstrap
- **APIs**: Spoonacular, YouTube

The foundational languages—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—forms the backbone of our frontend development. This combination ensures a responsive, visually appealing, and interactive user interface. Employing Bootstrap makes our frontend development efficient and responsive. The choice of React brings dynamic interactivity to our platform.
